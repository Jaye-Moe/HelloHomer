# HelloHomer
A simple project that counts the number of times you tap a graphic

This project is based on the Android tutorial created by JetBrains at 

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/create-your-first-android-application.html#build-run-Android-application

It counts the number of times that you tap on Homer Simpson.

This is the first Android app that I have created.
